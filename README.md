# runpod-serverless

A template for transcribing Hebrew audio using runpod.io serverless infrastructure.

Note: if you register at [runpod.io], we'd like to ask you to consider using our [referral link](https://runpod.io/?ref=06octndf).
It provides us with more credits, which we can then use to provide better services.

## Description

This project provides a serverless solution for transcribing Hebrew audio files. It leverages runpod.io's infrastructure to process audio files efficiently and return transcriptions.
It is part of the [ivrit.ai](https://ivrit.ai) non-profit project.

## Contents

- `Dockerfile`: Used to create the Docker image for the serverless function.
- `infer.py`: The main script that handles the transcription process, placed inside the Docker image.

## Setting up your inference endpoint

1. Log in to [runpod.io]
2. Choose Menu->Serverless
3. Choose New Endpoint
4. Select the desired worker configuration.
   - You can choose the cheapest worker (16GB GPU, $0.00016/second as of August 1st, 2024).
   - Active workers can be 0, max workers is 1 or more.
   - GPUs/worker should be set to 1.
   - Container image should be set to **yairlifshitz/faster-whisper-v2-d4:v1.0**, or your own Docker image (instruction later on how to build this).
   - Container disk should have at least 20 GB.
5. Click Deploy.

## Building your own Docker image

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/runpod-serverless.git
cd runpod-serverless
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t runpod-serverless .
```

3. Push the image to a public Docker repository:

a. If you haven't already, create an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

b. Log in to Docker Hub from your command line:
   ```
   docker login
   ```

c. Tag your image with your Docker Hub username:
   ```
   docker tag runpod-serverless yourusername/runpod-serverless:latest
   ```

d. Push the image to Docker Hub:
   ```
   docker push yourusername/runpod-serverless:latest
   ```

4. Set up a serverless function on runpod.io using the pushed image.

## Usage

Once deployed on runpod.io, you can transcribe Hebrew audio either by providing a URL to transcribe (up to 200MB), or by uploading a file (up to 10MB).

### URL-based transcription

```
import runpod
import base64

payload = { 'type' : 'url', 'url' : 'https://your-audio-url' }

runpod.api_key = '<Your runpod.io API key>'
ep = runpod.Endpoint("<endpoint key>")
res = ep.run_sync(payload)
```

### File upload

```
import runpod
import base64

mp3_data = open('<file>.mp3', 'rb').read()
data = base64.b64encode(mp3_data).decode('utf-8')
payload = { 'type' : 'blob', 'data' : data }

runpod.api_key = '<Your runpod.io API key>'
ep = runpod.Endpoint("<endpoint key>")
res = ep.run_sync(payload)
```
